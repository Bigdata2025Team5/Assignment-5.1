# AI Disclosure

As we worked on our assignment, we used AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity to help us tackle a few key challenges. These tools provided valuable insights that helped us better understand certain concepts and components of our system. Here’s how we used them:

1. **Understanding RAG in Langgraph**  
   We used AI to help us wrap our heads around how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) works within Langgraph. This gave us a clearer picture of how to incorporate RAG into our project and made it easier to implement effectively.

2. **Learning About Langgraph’s Architecture and Agents**  
   AI played a key role in helping us understand how Langgraph is built using different agents. It helped us get a better sense of how everything fits together, making it easier to work with the framework.

3. **Fetching Data from Different Agents**  
   We also leaned on AI to understand how to pull data from various agents. With its help, we figured out the best strategies for extracting and integrating data, which was essential for our project.
